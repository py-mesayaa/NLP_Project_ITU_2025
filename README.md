# Natural Language Processing @ ITU 2025

This repository contains the final project for the *Natural Language Processing* course at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU), Spring 2025.  
The project was conducted by **Alex J.**, **Simon B.A.**, and **Ivett P.**

---

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main notebooks:

1. **`1_XLMR_NER_tagger.ipynb`**  
   Trains a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using XLM-RoBERTa.

2. **`2_XLMR_Cultural_classifier.ipynb`**  
   Trains a cultural classification model, also based on XLM-RoBERTa.

3. **`3_Combined_models_and_analysis.ipynb`**  
   Loads the best performing models from the previous steps and performs combined analysis.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the results locally:

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install all required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt```
   
### Run the Notebooks

2. Open and execute the notebooks in this order:

  1. `1_XLMR_NER_tagger.ipynb`  
  2. `2_XLMR_Cultural_classifier.ipynb`  
  3. `3_Combined_models_and_analysis.ipynb`

> **Note:**  
> Before running `3_Combined_models_and_analysis.ipynb`, make sure to load the best models from the previous two steps.
