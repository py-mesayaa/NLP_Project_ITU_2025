sensing	O
my	O

that	O

Hello	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
originally	O
inquiring	O
about	O
purchasing	O
a	O
Cross	B-PER
or	O
Signac	B-PER
impressionist	O
lithograph	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
them	O
and	O
purchased	O
both	O
from	O
a	O
gallery	O
in	O
London	B-LOC
,	O
William	B-ORG
Weston	I-ORG
.	O

They	O
should	O
be	O
delivered	O
this	O
week	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
beautiful	O
and	O
will	O
add	O
a	O
lot	O
to	O
our	O
collection	O
.	O

By	O
the	O
way	O
the	O
Lichtenstein	B-PER
is	O
up	O
and	O
hanging	O
in	O
our	O
formal	O
living	O
room	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
magnificent	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
also	O
purchased	O
an	O
Appel	B-PER
in	O
the	O
last	O
month	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
interested	O
in	O
several	O
artists	O
.	O

Actually	O
,	O
a	O
lot	O
.	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
looking	O
for	O
one	O
or	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
following	O
.	O

My	O
concept	O
is	O
that	O
over	O
time	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
own	O
one	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
following	O
artists	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
all	O
depending	O
when	O
I	O
find	O
something	O
that	O
we	O
really	O
like	O
.	O

I	O
listed	O
all	O
of	O
our	O
(	O
sometimes	O
mine	O
vs.	O
my	O
wife	O
's	O
favorites	O
and	O
priorities	O
)	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
kind	O
of	O
in	O
rank	O
order	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
stated	O
if	O
I	O
find	O
the	O
piece	O
that	O
I	O
like	O
we	O
will	O
purchase	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
want	O
signed	O
and	O
numbered	O
.	O

I	O
realize	O
that	O
some	O
were	O
not	O
signed	O
by	O
the	O
artist	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
important	O
fact	O
in	O
my	O
buying	O
decision	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
realize	O
that	O
some	O
may	O
not	O
have	O
done	O
any	O
works	O
on	O
paper	O
or	O
they	O
are	O
outrageously	O
expensive	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
Rothko	B-PER
or	O
Kline	B-PER
did	O
any	O
work	O
on	O
paper	O
.	O

At	O
least	O
that	O
is	O
what	O
I	O
am	O
thinking	O
now	O

By	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
interested	O
in	O
re-looking	O
at	O
a	O
Picasso	B-PER
(	O
although	O
we	O
have	O
2	O
)	O
that	O
your	O
gallery	O
had	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
years	O
ago	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
cubist	O
piece	O
from	O
the	O
1920s	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
you	O
called	O
the	O
technique	O
a	O
"	O
push	O
wa	O
"	O
(	O
pronunciation	O
Vs	O
an	O
attempt	O
at	O
the	O
proper	O
spelling	O
)	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
for	O
sale	O
in	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
galleries	O
in	O
SF	B-LOC
and	O
was	O
about	O
$	B-MISC
20,000	O
.	O

Is	O
there	O
1	O
available	O
?	O

Also	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
thinking	O
about	O
the	O
Matisse	B-PER
we	O
discussed	O
before	O
but	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
other	O
artists	O
I	O
am	O
interested	O
in	O
and	O
it	O
may	O
remain	O
on	O
the	O
back	O
burner	O
because	O
we	O
already	O
have	O
one	O

The	O
pricing	O
that	O

given	O

With	O
regard	O
to	O
a	O
global	O
message	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
key	O
points	O
around	O
fundamental	O
operating	O
standards	O
are	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
intended	O
to	O
be	O
global	O
in	O
nature	O

applied	O
to	O
every	O
commodity	O
and	O
every	O
location	O
where	O
we	O
engage	O
in	O
trading	O
activities	O
.	O

With	O
these	O
operating	O
standards	O
implemented	O
worldwide	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
know	O
as	O
operations	O
professionals	O
that	O
risk	O
is	O
being	O
mitigated	O
and	O
we	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
ensure	O
Enron	B-ORG

that	O
there	O
is	O
consistency	O
in	O

These	O
global	O
standards	O
also	O
should	O
enable	O

to	O
expand	O
its	O

reach	O
more	O
quickly	O

with	O
well	O

requirements	O
with	O

to	O

I	O
am	O
not	O

from	O
the	O

that	O
the	O
global	O
nature	O
of	O
this	O

comes	O

a	O
question	O

The	O
last	O
I	O

I	O
do	O

believe	O
that	O

quite	O
at	O
the	O
point	O
that	O
we	O

(	O
hopefully	O
)	O
our	O

Sorry	O
that	O
this	O
response	O
looks	O
so	O
long	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
interrupted	O
20	O
times	O
while	O
responding	O

so	O
I	O
hope	O
that	O
it	O

sense	O

Thanks	O

your	O

was	O
sorry	O
to	O
hear	O
about	O
your	O
dad	O
.	O

It	O
sounds	O
as	O
though	O
his	O
health	O
has	O
deteriorated	O
significantly	O
.	O

These	O
are	O
always	O
difficult	O
times	O

As	O
I	O
watched	O
my	O
mother	O

father	O
's	O
health	O
deteriorate	O
and	O
ultimately	O
watched	O
them	O
die	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
defining	O
time	O
in	O
our	O
lives	O

But	O
we	O
can	O
be	O
very	O

Craig	B-PER

compared	O
to	O
my	O

,	O
he	O
's	O

about	O
his	O

Then	O
,	O
also	O

he	O
's	O

how	O
he	O
's	O
going	O

They	O
would	O
only	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
6	O
month	O
lease	O
when	O
he	O
renewed	O
his	O

n't	O

asked	O

to	O

you	O

As	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
the	O
suffix	O
ONLINE	O
is	O
purely	O
descriptive	O
and	O
now	O
used	O
by	O
many	O
companies	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
any	O
trade	O
mark	O
registration	O
that	O
incorporates	O
the	O
word	O
ONLINE	O
as	O
a	O
suffix	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
you	O
use	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
enable	O
its	O
owner	O
to	O
prevent	O
others	O
from	O
using	O
the	O
word	O
ONLINE	O
.	O

Given	O
the	O
above	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
adequate	O
protection	O
for	O
the	O

your	O

I	O

say	O
that	O
another	O

probably	O
unnecessary	O

However	O

Gerald	B-PER

Compression	I-MISC
Service	I-MISC
Contract	I-MISC
in	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
Load	O
Control	O
Management	O
.	O

My	O
understanding	O
was	O
that	O
ECS	B-ORG
was	O
to	O
provide	O
a	O
means	O
to	O
access	O
CDEC	B-ORG
's	I-ORG
online	O
profile	O
in	O
order	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
decision	O
to	O
avoid	O
running	O
the	O
compressor	O
during	O
CDEC	B-ORG
's	I-ORG
peak	O
load	O
periods	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
not	O
received	O
access	O
to	O
this	O
information	O
which	O
has	O
resulted	O
so	O
far	O
in	O
additional	O
electric	O
cost	O
of	O
$	B-MISC
200,987.33	O
for	O
the	O
period	O
of	O
July	O
through	O
September	O
.	O

Additional	O
cost	O
will	O
be	O
incurred	O
for	O
the	O
remainder	O
of	O
this	O
year	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
review	O
yet	O
.	O

This	O
cost	O
is	O
averaging	O
$	B-MISC
79,000	O
per	O
month	O
if	O
we	O
continue	O
to	O
run	O
the	O
compressor	O
as	O
we	O
have	O
in	O
August	O
and	O
September	O
.	O

Good	O
point	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
'm	O
comfortable	O
we	O
're	O
covered	O
because	O
our	O
bidders	O
were	O
all	O
bidding	O
on	O
a	O
chunk	O
of	O
capacity	O
and	O
primary	O
points	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
deemed	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
notice	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
alternate	O
point	O
rights	O
(	O
it	O
s	O
in	O
the	O
tariff	O
)	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
wanted	O
to	O
submit	O
a	O
bid	O
that	O
had	O
a	O
different	O
rate	O
for	O
primaries	O
and	O
alternates	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
done	O
so	O
.	O

None	O
of	O
them	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
importantly	O
,	O
the	O
winning	O
bidders	O
did	O
not	O
.	O

Our	O
letter	O
agreement	O
simply	O
memorializes	O
that	O
we	O
will	O
charge	O
the	O
same	O
negotiated	O
rate	O
whether	O
the	O
gas	O
flows	O
on	O
primaries	O
or	O
alternates	O
.	O

I	O
assume	O
from	O
your	O
message	O
you	O
are	O
OK	O
with	O
this	O
and	O
they	O
can	O
get	O
it	O

DF	B-PER

I	O
just	O
got	O
done	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
underlying	O
contract	O
language	O
as	O
set	O
forth	O
in	O
the	O
pro	O
forma	O
service	O
agreement	O
in	O
the	O
tariff	O
and	O
it	O
specifically	O
says	O
that	O
the	O
max	O
rate	O
would	O
apply	O
unless	O
a	O
discount	O
or	O
negotiated	O
rate	O
has	O
been	O
agreed	O
to	O
.	O

My	O
concern	O
with	O
adding	O
the	O
language	O
below	O
is	O
,	O
could	O
it	O
be	O
argued	O
that	O
not	O
everyone	O
knew	O
the	O
rate	O
would	O
or	O
could	O
apply	O
at	O
any	O
point	O
,	O
since	O
we	O
just	O
stated	O
Topack	B-MISC
and	O
Needles	B-MISC
and	O
if	O
they	O
knew	O
they	O
might	O

something	O

to	O

The	O
difficulty	O
lies	O
in	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
confirmation	O

reads	O
the	O
counterparty	O

My	O

is	O
that	O
Global	B-MISC

use	O
the	O

has	O
signed	O

my	O

that	O

team	O
returns	O
inappropriate	O
Applications	O
to	O
the	O
customer	O
until	O
they	O
are	O
correctly	O
completed	O

In	O
this	O
particular	O
case	O

I	O
was	O
waiting	O

(	O

The	O

I	O

so	O
Nicki	B-PER
(	O
the	O
little	O
girl	O
-	O
10	O
yrs.	O
old	O
)	O
and	O
I	O
waited	O
for	O
the	O
bus	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
,	O
8:15	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
her	O

.	O

On	O

of	O

,	O
I	O
had	O
quiz	O
at	O
8	O

Which	O
I	O
then	O
realized	O
I	O
missed	O
.	O

I	O
decided	O
that	O
Nicki	B-PER
would	O
just	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
on	O
her	O
own	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
her	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
any	O
relatives	O
that	O
would	O
want	O
to	O
know	O
of	O
her	O
whereabouts	O
.	O

I	O
called	O
her	O
grandmother	O
and	O
explained	O
things	O
to	O
her	O
.	O

Pretty	O
strange	O
...	O
aye	O
.	O

A	O
bus	O
that	O
runs	O
through	O
UofH	B-ORG
arrived	O
and	O
I	O
almost	O
got	O
on	O
without	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
n't	O
do	O
it	O
.	O

Finally	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
little	O
girl	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
accompany	O
me	O
to	O
school	O
(	O
8:30	O
am	O
)	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
only	O
15	O
minutes	O
left	O
of	O
class	O
.	O

I	O
stayed	O
for	O
the	O
remainder	O
of	O
the	O

After	O
class	O
we	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
bus	O
stop	O
and	O
within	O
minutes	O
her	O
bus	O
arrived	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
the	O
bus	O
driver	O
where	O
to	O
drop	O
her	O
off	O
.	O

I	O
notified	O
her	O
grandmother	O
with	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
departure	O

And	O
I	O
was	O
relieved	O
when	O

Initially	O
our	O

along	O

The	O

of	O
the	O

will	O
be	O
on	O
how	O

Hi	O
all	O

There	O
are	O
already	O
several	O
forums	O
around	O
the	O

focused	O
on	O
discussing	O
Guild	B-MISC

,	O
so	O
why	O
create	O
a	O
new	O
one	O
?	O

I	O
say	O
why	O
not	O
?	O

The	O
main	O
reason	O
is	O
Google	B-ORG
is	O
more	O
accessible	O
to	O
the	O
global	O
community	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
rest	O
assured	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
away	O

I	O
have	O
seen	O
great	O
fan	O
sites	O
suddenly	O
disappear	O
without	O
notice	O
and	O
for	O
no	O
reason	O
.	O

Usually	O
this	O
happens	O
because	O
the	O
developer	O
of	O
the	O
site	O
can	O
no	O
longer	O
afford	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
bandwidth	O
being	O
used	O
.	O

That	O
said	O
,	O
the	O
maintenance	O
of	O
this	O
forum	O
is	O
handled	O
by	O
Google	B-ORG
and	O
thus	O
will	O
remain	O
reliable	O
and	O
it	O
will	O
ultimately	O
give	O
us	O
more	O
time	O
to	O
play	O

I	O
'm	O
nothing	O
more	O

I	O
'm	O
unsure	O
of	O
this	O

because	O
once	O
I	O
watched	O
a	O

complete	O

far	O
as	O
I	O
understand	O
,	O
this	O
ad	O
will	O
get	O
dogs	O
excited	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
question	O
is	O
:	O
Can	O
dogs	O
actually	O
see	O
the	O
images	O
featured	O
in	O
the	O
advert	O
like	O

Also	O
,	O
can	O

remember	O

,	O
humans	O
?	O

If	O
so	O
,	O
then	O
does	O
that	O
mean	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
watched	O
a	O
scary	O
movie	O
and	O
your	O
dog	O
/	O
cat	O
/	O
parrot	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
room	O
as	O
you	O
they	O
will	O
also	O
get	O
scared	O
?	O

I	O
would	O
n't	O
know	O
--	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
particularly	O
like	O
scary	O
movies	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
n't	O
tried	O
this	O
with	O
my	O
pet	O
.	O

Although	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
that	O
scary	O
movies	O
will	O
affect	O
pets	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
;	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
they	O
'll	O
forget	O
sometime	O
--	O
or	O
am	O
I	O
wrong	O
?	O

So	O
what	O
about	O
T.V.	O
?	O

Do	O
dogs	O
enjoy	O
watching	O
T.V.	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
T.V.	O
is	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
flickering	O
pictures	O
that	O
are	O
streamed	O
together	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
moving	O
picture	O
.	O

The	O
pictures	O
are	O
broadcast	O
at	O
a	O
rate	O
of	O
about	O
60	O
Hz	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
how	O
fast	O
they	O
need	O
to	O
move	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
as	O
a	O
moving	O
,	O
flawless	O
picture	O
.	O

To	O
a	O
dog	O
,	O
watching	O
T.V.	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
like	O
watching	O
and	O
old	O
scratchy	O
silent	O
film	O
because	O
their	O
flicker	O
fusion	O
seems	O
to	O
occur	O
at	O
a	O
rate	O
of	O
70	O
to	O
80	O
Hz	O
.	O

So	O
they	O
see	O
the	O
pictures	O
flicker	O
slower	O
and	O
there	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
choppy	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

So	O
chances	O
are	O
that	O
if	O
your	O
dog	O
likes	O
to	O
watch	O
T.V.	O
,	O
it	O
’s	O
probably	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
sounds	O
.	O

Hearing	O
is	O
a	O
dog	O
’s	O
secondary	O
sense	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
discuss	O
that	O
in	O

Yes	O
they	O

i	O
m	O
pretty	O
sure	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
see	O
things	O

my	O

chases	O

How	O

I	O
be	O

you	O

Can	O
rabbits	O

chickens	O
live	O
together	O
?	O

I	O
am	O
thinking	O
about	O
getting	O
a	O
rabbit	O
as	O
a	O
pet	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
parents	O
said	O
that	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
stay	O
outside	O
.	O

We	O
also	O
own	O
two	O
chickens	O
that	O
are	O
kept	O
in	O
a	O
run	O
behind	O
out	O
garage	O
/	O
barn	O
thing	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
already	O
a	O
little	O
dog	O
house	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
turn	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
rabbit	O
hutch	O
being	O
kept	O
back	O
there	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
thinking	O
about	O
keeping	O
the	O
rabbit	O
in	O
the	O
run	O
with	O
the	O
chickens	O
,	O
but	O
keeping	O
the	O
chickens	O
in	O
the	O
coop	O
and	O
the	O
rabbit	O
in	O
the	O
hutch	O
at	O
night	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
day	O
time	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
okay	O
for	O
the	O
rabbit	O
to	O
hop	O
around	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
chickens	O
?	O

We	O
feed	O
the	O
chickens	O
scraps	O
of	O
veggies	O
and	O
fruits	O
throughout	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
nothing	O
that	O
a	O
rabbit	O
would	O
n't	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
digest	O
just	O
fine	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
can	O
rabbits	O
and	O
chickens	O
live	O
together	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
they	O
have	O
separate	O
places	O
for	O
their	O
food	O
and	O
water	O
?	O

(	O
The	O

would	O
have	O
an	O
opening	O
only	O
big	O
enough	O
for	O
the	O
rabbit	O

the	O
chickens	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O

the	O

Also	O
,	O
is	O
it	O
okay	O
if	O
the	O
rabbit	O
occasionally	O
sneaks	O
a	O

I	O
just	O

Thank	O

Yes	O
,	O

be	O
sure	O
that	O
your	O
chickens	O
are	O
all	O
hens	O
(	O
I	O
mean	O
not	O
roosters	O
)	O
,	O
Roosters	O
may	O
attack	O
rabbits	O
or	O
anything	O
they	O
see	O
moving	O
,	O
so	O
be	O
aware	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
hens	O
are	O
friendly	O
with	O
almost	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
pets	O
!	O

From	O
my	O
experience	O
Hens	O
(	O
Not	O
roosters	O
)	O

very	O

Guinea	O

Rabbits	O
,	O
etc	O

Be	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O

your	O
rabbits	O
non-veg	O
items	O
!	O

You	O
said	O
they	O
live	O
in	O
different	O
cages	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
free	O
in	O
day	O
,	O
so	O
no	O
problem	O
,	O
do	O
n't	O
put	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
one	O
cage	O
because	O
rabbits	O
bedding	O
is	O
different	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
hens	O
,	O
wet	O
bedding	O
can	O
cause	O
diseases	O
in	O
them	O
!	O

So	O
,	O
do	O
n't	O
put	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
one	O
cage	O

Good	O
luck	O
!	O

yea	O
i	O
guess	O
but	O
rabbits	O
a	O
easily	O
escape	O
a	O
pen	O
or	O
another	O
rabbit	O
could	O
get	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
that	O
rabbit	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
opposite	O
gender	O

So	O
be	O
very	O
careful	O
and	O
some	O
feeds	O
could	O
be	O
toxic	O
to	O
rabbits	O
and	O
safe	O
for	O

do	O

iw	O

just	O
stick	O
him	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
let	O
your	O

have	O
a	O
nice	O

once	O

snakes	O
jaws	O
detach	O
for	O

why	O

if	O
you	O
do	O
want	O
him	O

just	O

you	O

Ok	O
so	O
if	O
youre	O
snake	O
will	O
take	O
pre-killed	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
"	O
gas	O
it	O

Just	O
put	O
the	O

in	O
a	O

with	O
no	O

and	O
wait	O

it	O

then	O
feed	O
it	O

If	O
it	O
wo	O
n't	O
take	O
pre-killed	O
and	O
you	O
usually	O
feed	O
live	O
then	O
you	O
could	O
hold	O
the	O
rat	O
by	O
the	O
tail	O
and	O
whack	O
it	O
against	O
a	O

surface	O

a	O

I	O
do	O

that	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O

I'd	O
not	O

properly	O
you	O
'll	O
end	O
up	O
really	O

the	O

but	O
not	O
stunning	O
him	O
enough	O
to	O

to	O
your	O

I	O
would	O
do	O
the	O
tupperwear	O
idea	O
TBH	O
-	O
easiest	O
and	O
most	O
humane	O
.	O

You	O
could	O
also	O
just	O
wait	O
until	O
the	O
rat	O
passes	O
out	O
for	O
about	O
1	O
minute	O
and	O
them	O
feed	O
it	O
-	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
,	O
it	O
could	O
still	O
have	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
heart	O
beat	O
and	O
be	O
slightly	O
still	O
alive	O
.	O

And	O
also	O
maybe	O
try	O
holding	O
the	O
rat	O
in	O
feeding	O
prongs	O
so	O
your	O
snake	O
can	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
hold	O

on	O
his	O

Remember	O
snakes	O
can	O
go	O
a	O
while	O
without	O
eating	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
winter	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
usually	O
go	O
deep	O
underground	O
and	O
enter	O
a	O
hibernation	O
-	O
like	O
state	O
called	O
brumation	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
characterized	O
by	O
a	O
slowed	O
metabolism	O
and	O
reduced	O
activity	O
.	O

King	O
snakes	O
sometimes	O
stop	O
eating	O
,	O
particularly	O
during	O
the	O
cooler	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
a	O
natural	O
instinct	O
to	O
hibernate	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
snake	O
is	O
not	O
pregnant	O
or	O
shedding	O
,	O
and	O
its	O
enclosure	O
is	O
properly	O
equipped	O
,	O
a	O
loss	O
of	O
appetite	O
probably	O
signals	O
a	O
beginning	O
of	O
hibernation	O
.	O

Hibernation	O
is	O
natural	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
necessity	O
for	O
snakes	O
that	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
bred	O
.	O

Another	O
thing	O
that	O
can	O
cause	O
a	O
king	O
snake	O
to	O
stop	O
eating	O
is	O
shedding	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
tell	O
when	O
your	O
king	O
snake	O
is	O
about	O
to	O
shed	O
,	O
because	O
its	O
eyes	O
will	O
get	O
milky	O
looking	O
.	O

Its	O
body	O
will	O
be	O
dull	O
looking	O
,	O
too	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
the	O
snake	O
will	O
begin	O
to	O
shed	O
its	O
skin	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
some	O
snakes	O
will	O
routinely	O
go	O
off	O
their	O
food	O
in	O
both	O
the	O
summer	O
and	O
winter	O
,	O
feeding	O
mainly	O
in	O

Here	O
s	O
my	O
reason	O
.....	O

I	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
that	O
you	O
did	O
for	O
christmas	O
.	O

I	O
ended	O
up	O
getting	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
zebra	O
finches	O
for	O
christmas	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
cool	O
and	O
all	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
chirping	O
and	O
doing	O
their	O
every	O
day	O
business	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
weeks	O
I	O
got	O
tired	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
quite	O
messy	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
not	O
hold	O
or	O
pet	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
ve	O
tried	O
to	O
tame	O
them	O
and	O
they	O
just	O
would	O
not	O
get	O
tamed	O
.	O

They	O
do	O
nt	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
held	O
or	O
touched	O
.	O

I	O
want	O
a	O
bird	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
hold	O
and	O
do	O
tricks	O
.	O

I	O
still	O
have	O
them	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
doing	O
well	O
.	O

A	O
couple	O
of	O
months	O
after	O
I	O
got	O
parakeets	O
/	O
budgies	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
adorable	O
they	O
have	O
beautiful	O
colors	O
and	O
personality	O
.	O

I	O
love	O
them	O
.	O

First	O
of	O
all	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
tame	O
.	O

I	O
tamed	O
them	O
in	O
4	O
days	O
.	O

They	O
can	O
do	O
tricks	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
nt	O
messy	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
family	O
loves	O
them	O
.	O

My	O
parents	O
even	O
plays	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
a	O
big	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
family	O
.	O

I	O
hope	O
this	O
helps	O
you	O
with	O
your	O
decision	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
both	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
noise	O
level	O
.	O

When	O
choosing	O
a	O
parakeet	O
look	O
for	O
a	O
young	O
one	O
.	O

(	O
the	O
younger	O
the	O
eaiser	O
to	O
tame	O
)	O
Look	O
for	O
clean	O
smooth	O
feathers	O
,	O
beak	O
,	O
and	O
clean	O
vent	O
feathers	O
(	O
the	O
feathers	O
around	O
the	O
butt	O
..	O
dirty	O
vent	O
feathers	O
means	O
the	O
bird	O
is	O
not	O
healthy	O
)	O
Look	O
for	O
a	O
dark	O
eye	O
with	O
no	O
circles	O
(	O
the	O
older	O
ones	O
have	O
a	O
circle	O
ring	O
in	O
their	O
eyes	O
)	O
.	O

Look	O
for	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
stripes	O
in	O
their	O
head	O
that	O
starts	O
from	O
the	O
beak	O
and	O
goes	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
back	O
fo	O
the	O
bird	O
.	O

the	O
stripes	O
are	O
like	O
hair	O
the	O
less	O
stipes	O
the	O
older	O
.	O

(	O
think	O
of	O
a	O
balding	O
man	O
lol	O
)	O
Look	O
for	O
clean	O
feathers	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
want	O
a	O
boy	O
the	O
cere	O
(	O
the	O
nostrils	O
piece	O
above	O
the	O
beak	O
)	O
must	O
be	O
blue	O
.	O

The	O
girl	O
has	O
either	O
pink	O
or	O
brown	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
that	O
you	O
get	O
two	O
parakeets	O
.	O

But	O
get	O
either	O
one	O
male	O
and	O
one	O
female	O
,	O
or	O
two	O
males	O
.	O

Do	O
not	O
get	O
two	O
females	O
.	O

They	O
sometimes	O
do	O
nt	O
get	O
along	O
(	O
you	O
know	O
how	O
some	O
girls	O
are	O
lol	O
hahahaahh	O
but	O
for	O
real	O
though	O
,	O
two	O
girls	O
tend	O
to	O
fight	O
a	O
lot	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
one	O
yellow	O
girl	O
and	O
a	O
green	O
and	O
yellow	O
boy	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
the	O
best	O
!	O

If	O
you	O
choose	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
parakeet	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
trick	O
that	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
tame	O
them	O
.	O

However	O
if	O
you	O
plan	O
on	O
getting	O
one	O
,	O
then	O
get	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
they	O
need	O
company	O
.	O

My	O
mom	O
told	O
me	O
how	O
to	O
tame	O
them	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
happy	O
with	O
the	O
results	O
.	O

It	O
took	O
me	O
4	O
days	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
new	O
one	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
step	O
on	O
and	O
eat	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
hand	O

These	O
are	O
the	O
steps	O
I	O
used	O
.	O

Honestly	O
they	O
have	O
worked	O
for	O
me	O
twice	O
with	O
my	O
parakeets	O

Hopefully	O
they	O
will	O
work	O
for	O
you	O

in	O

at	O

We	O
had	O
a	O

We	O
had	O
an	O
inside	O

and	O
it	O
is	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O

There	O
are	O
so	O
many	O
things	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
only	O
use	O
your	O

The	O
children	O
can	O
be	O
checked	O
in	O
and	O
checked	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
safe	O

a	O

is	O
that	O

have	O
the	O

for	O
the	O
entire	O
cruise	O

Our	O
waiter	O
quickly	O
grasped	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
I	O
like	O
Ginger	O

rather	O
spicy	O

my	O

taste	O
ran	O

less	O

Since	O

we	O
almost	O
always	O
went	O
along	O

were	O
never	O
sorry	O
we	O
did	O

Obviously	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
full	O

alcohol	O
for	O

wanted	O
it	O

If	O
you	O
should	O
miss	O
a	O
meal	O
,	O
you	O
also	O
missed	O
a	O
great	O
show	O

but	O
food	O
is	O
always	O
available	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
consistently	O
good	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
gained	O
three	O

I	O

I	O

it	O

Well	O

almost	O
two	O

was	O
SO	O
flirty	O

He	O
always	O

That	O

I	O
was	O

realizing	O
at	O
that	O
point	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
interested	O

Right	O

so	O
he	O
ended	O
up	O
leaving	O
one	O

out	O
of	O
my	O
horse	O
s	O
foot	O
(	O
I	O
've	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
a	O
farrier	O
doing	O
this	O
)	O
and	O
telling	O
me	O
to	O
call	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
(	O
first	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
few	O

)	O
and	O
he	O
'd	O
come	O
back	O
out	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
remember	O
to	O
call	O
like	O
3	O
times	O
before	O
he	O
left	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
waited	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
call	O
because	O
I	O
was	O

and	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O

to	O
hang	O
out	O
after	O
;)	O

Anyway	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
was	O
2	O
days	O
ago	O
that	O
I	O
called	O
and	O
left	O
a	O
message	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
still	O
has	O
n't	O
called	O
back	O
yet	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
I	O
should	O
call	O
him	O
again	O
tomorrow	O
or	O
not	O
?	O

I	O
know	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
say	O
to	O
wait	O
until	O
he	O
calls	O
you	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
's	O
different	O
because	O
I	O
'm	O
a	O
client	O
and	O
technically	O
that	O
's	O
all	O
I	O
am	O
at	O
this	O
point	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
though	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
'm	O
a	O
client	O
he	O
should	O
really	O
of	O
called	O
back	O
by	O
now	O
because	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
leave	O
a	O
customer	O
hanging	O
.	O

He	O
did	O
n't	O
have	O
my	O
number	O
either	O
because	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
I	O
've	O
called	O
HIM	O
instead	O
of	O
his	O
dad	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
a	O
father	O
and	O
son	O
business	O
.	O

Anyway	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
appreciate	O
ANY	O
insight	O
on	O
this	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

Thank	O
you	O
for	O
reading	O
if	O
you	O
did	O
!	O
:)	O

Ok	O
,	O
well	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
him	O
being	O
a	O
bad	O
farrier	O
for	O
leaving	O
a	O
nail	O
out	O
-	O
That	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
extremely	O
well	O
known	O
farriers	O
in	O
the	O
area	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
concerned	O
if	O
the	O
shoe	O
fell	O
off	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
missing	O
one	O
lousy	O
nail	O
.	O

The	O
reason	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
did	O
n't	O
put	O
that	O
nail	O
in	O
was	O
because	O
he	O
"	O
did	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
risk	O
it	O
"	O
with	O
my	O
horse	O
's	O
horrible	O
feet	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
about	O
the	O
fourth	O
time	O
they	O
've	O
done	O
my	O
horse	O
's	O
feet	O
because	O
I	O
just	O
switched	O
back	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
reason	O
I	O
switched	O
away	O
from	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
is	O
because	O
my	O
good	O
friend	O
who	O
apprenticed	O
with	O
them	O
was	O
starting	O
out	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
left	O
my	O
horse	O
without	O
a	O
shoe	O
for	O
TWO	O
WEEKS	O
(	O
now	O
that	O
's	O
what	O
I	O
call	O
a	O
crap	O
farrier	O
)	O
.	O

Which	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
add	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
foot	O
that	O
keeps	O
crumbling	O
with	O
the	O
nails	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
obviously	O
I	O
switched	O
back	O
to	O
these	O
guys	O
.	O

Ok	O
,	O
calm	O
down	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
like	O
he	O
's	O
some	O
stranger	O
that	O
came	O
up	O
and	O
groped	O
me	O
lol	O
.	O

I	O
've	O
known	O
the	O
guy	O
for	O
about	O
10	O
years	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
21	O
,	O
so	O
yeah	O
we	O
were	O
both	O
kids	O
when	O
we	O
knew	O
each	O
other	O
!	O

He	O
is	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
older	O
than	O
me	O
.	O

And	O
yes	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
like	O
him	O
.	O

To	O
answer	O
Barry	B-PER
White	I-PER
,	O
yes	O
that	O
did	O
occur	O
to	O
me	O
:)	O
I	O
hope	O
that	O
is	O
all	O
he	O
's	O
waiting	O
for	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
very	O
easily	O
just	O
call	O
me	O
and	O
say	O
hey	O
I	O
'm	O
busy	O
right	O
now	O
,	O
I	O
'll	O
call	O
you	O
when	O
I	O
can	O
come	O
out	O
.	O

And	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
scheduled	O
visits	O
go	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
.	O

I	O
've	O
never	O
done	O
that	O
before	O
though	O
either	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
always	O
just	O
"	O
Okay	O
,	O
they're	O
feet	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
better	O
call	O
the	O
farrier	O
.	O
"	O

And	O
they	O
usually	O
come	O
out	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
.	O

He	O
will	O
call	O
you	O
back	O
I	O
m	O
sure	O
!	O

Sounds	O
like	O
He	O
really	O
likes	O

you	O
need	O
to	O

)	O
anyway	O
,	O
I	O
find	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
busy	O
so	O
I	O
would	O
wait	O
a	O
week	O
lo9nger	O
and	O
if	O
still	O
no	O
reply	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
call	O
but	O
do	O
n’t	O
leave	O
a	O

you	O
do	O
n’t	O
have	O
to	O
necessarily	O
wait	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
call	O

From	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
of	O
a	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
client	O

he	O

Cute	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
I	O
'd	O
call	O
a	O
different	O

he	O
's	O
doing	O
a	O
sub-par	O

at	O
something	O
he	O
needs	O

Anyone	O

I	O
have	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
a	O
super	O
nice	O
6	O
year	O
old	O
for	O
free	O
.	O

He	O
's	O
not	O
lame	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
's	O
been	O
having	O
issues	O
.	O

Here	O
's	O
what	O
the	O
owner	O
has	O
said	O
:	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
5	O
year	O
old	O
that	O
lost	O
all	O
of	O
his	O
cheek	O
muscle	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
about	O
3	O
-	O
4	O
months	O
ago	O
.	O

I	O
chalked	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
possible	O
nerve	O
damage	O
,	O
because	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
the	O
vet	O
thought	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
cheek	O
muscle	O
was	O
fine	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
theeth	O
problems	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
sent	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
trainers	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
September	O
to	O
be	O
started	O
on	O
the	O
barrels	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
him	O
back	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
the	O
month	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
lost	O
some	O
weight	O
but	O
attributed	O
that	O
to	O
be	O
worked	O
everyday	O
(	O
I	O
expected	O
him	O
to	O
drop	O
some	O
)	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
now	O
losing	O
the	O
cheek	O
muscle	O
on	O
the	O
left	O
side	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
and	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
dropping	O
weight	O
by	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

Had	O
him	O
to	O
a	O
dentist	O
yesterday	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
teeth	O
problems	O
.	O

He	O
can	O
eat	O
all	O
his	O
feed	O
and	O
does	O
n't	O
drop	O
any	O
,	O
but	O
can	O
not	O
eat	O
hay	O
from	O
lack	O
of	O
muscle	O
to	O
chew	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
gant	O
looking	O
in	O
his	O
flank	O
area	O
and	O
is	O
losing	O
topline	O
muscle	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
neurological	O
sign	O
that	O
he	O
shows	O
is	O
that	O
he	O
barely	O
drags	O
his	O
toes	O
and	O
sometimes	O
has	O
trouble	O
with	O
his	O
right	O
lead	O
.	O

The	O
horse	O
I	O
had	O
posted	O
about	O
a	O
couple	O
weeks	O
ago	O
with	O
the	O
atrophied	O
cheek	O
muscles	O
is	O
down	O
to	O
his	O
last	O
resort	O
for	O
life	O
.	O

I	O
CAN	O
NOT	O
afford	O
to	O
treat	O
whatever	O
is	O
wrong	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

NO	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
done	O
an	O
EPM	O
test	O
but	O
have	O
done	O
an	O
extensive	O
blood	O
panel	O
and	O
my	O
vet	O
did	O
a	O
neurological	O
physical	O
exam	O
.	O

We	O
elected	O
to	O
not	O
do	O
the	O
EPM	O
test	O
because	O
there	O
was	O
NO	O
neurological	O
signs	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
still	O
showing	O
no	O
signs	O
other	O
than	O
the	O
weight	O
loss	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
muscle	O
atrophy	O
.	O

He	O
eats	O
all	O
of	O
his	O
grain	O
but	O
it	O
just	O
takes	O
him	O
a	O
while	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
chewed	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
lack	O
of	O
muscle	O
in	O
his	O
jaws	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
might	O
get	O
the	O
horse	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
I	O
can	O
do	O
.	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
getting	O
with	O
my	O
vet	O
first	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
do	O
get	O
him	O
,	O
have	O
the	O
spinal	O
fluid	O
test	O
done	O
for	O
EPM	O
and	O
a	O
titer	O
test	O
.	O

Will	O
be	O
getting	O
a	O
copy	O
of	O
the	O
blood	O
results	O
the	O
owner	O
has	O
already	O
ran	O
as	O

I	O
have	O
no	O

or	O

a	O

had	O
an	O

at	O

10	O

I	O
can	O
say	O
all	O
of	O
our	O
EPM	O

were	O
treated	O
early	O
when	O
they	O
were	O

We	O
've	O

then	O
1	O
/	O
2	O

The	O
only	O
difference	O
we	O
noticed	O
is	O
that	O

seemed	O
to	O
do	O
worse	O
on	O

It	O
might	O
just	O
be	O

or	O
the	O
fact	O
those	O

Personally	O
I	O
think	O
you	O

figure	O
out	O
what	O
is	O
wrong	O
with	O
this	O

there	O
is	O

the	O
chance	O

this	O

The	O
night	O
I	O
drove	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
the	O

(	O
You	O
can	O
hear	O
the	O

Very	O
likely	O
it	O
needs	O
a	O
new	O
window	O

)	O
.	O

I	O
admit	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
paid	O
attention	O
to	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
little	O
things	O
while	O

(	O
But	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
certified	O

from	O
a	O

)	O

So	O
I	O
brought	O
the	O
car	O
back	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
under	O
warranty	O
and	O
want	O
to	O
charge	O
me	O

Who	O
knows	O
how	O

I	O
walked	O
away	O

So	O
my	O
advice	O
is	O
that	O
NEVER	O
TRUST	O
THIS	O

STAY	O
AWAY	O
AS	O

The	O

out	O
about	O

when	O

I	O
